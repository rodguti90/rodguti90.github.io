We studied the dynamics of multiple pulses propagating in multilevel atomic gases. This was a purely theoretical work in which we found analytical solutions and perform numerical simulations to Maxwell-Bloch equations, a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions demonstrated that it is possible to engineer pulse sequences that allow storing and manipulating information in the coherences of the atomic gas. 
These works were done in collaboration with J. H. Eberly at the University of Rochester, New York, USA.
