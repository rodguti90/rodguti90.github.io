Optomechanics is the coupling between light and mechanical degrees of freedom which is often exploited for ultra-precise measurements such as those carried out at LIGO for measuring gravitational waves. However, we are inserted in mechanical system at a nanometric scale. Specifically, we are putting in place wavefront shaping techniques, similar to those deployed for complex media, to enhance the precision with which we can monitor the movements of these systems, and ultimately exploit then to control them. This is a collaboration at the LuMIn lab with P. Verlot, L. Rondin, and T. Antoni.
