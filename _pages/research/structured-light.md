Structured light refers to optical fields with tailored spatial, spectral, or polarization distributions.  
We investigate how such light can be engineered and used to manipulate and probe complex systems.

### Research directions
- Generation of vortex and vector beams  
- Polarization-structured illumination  
- Wavefront shaping for targeted focusing
