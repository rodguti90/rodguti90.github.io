In standard imaging techniques, the resolution is limited by the diffraction limit set by the wavelength of light and the numerical aperture. However, if we know that the light we are collecting comes from a single emitter, it is possible to pinpoint its location with manometric precision, effectively beating the diffraction limit. This a priori knowledge can also be exploited to determine the orientation of the emitter which provides essential structural information for some biological sample. 
This work is carried out in collaboration with M. A. Alonso, S. Brasselet, and L. A. Alemán-Castañeda from the Fresnel Institute in Marseille for wide field fluorescent STORM-based imaging. In collaboration with F. Marquier at the LuMIn lab, we carry similar work to track nanoparticle dynamics exploiting second-harmonic generation and two-photon florescence.
