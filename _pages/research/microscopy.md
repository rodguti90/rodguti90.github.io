We design and implement advanced microscopy techniques based on structured illumination and wavefront shaping.  
Our goal is to push the limits of resolution, depth, and contrast in imaging through complex or scattering samples.

### Current directions
- Adaptive and computational microscopy  
- Deep tissue imaging  
- Nonlinear and holographic methods
