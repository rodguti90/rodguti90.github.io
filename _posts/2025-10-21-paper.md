Open Transmission Channels in Multimode Fiber Cavities with Random Mode Mixing
We’re excited to announce that our paper *“Wavefront Control in Complex Optical Systems”* has been published in **Physical Review Letters**.

This work explores how structured light can be optimized to focus through highly scattering environments, opening new avenues in biomedical imaging and photonics.
